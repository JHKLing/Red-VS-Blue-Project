# Red-VS-Blue-Project
In this project week, you will work on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which you will play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.

As the Red Team, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.
Then, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.

This project will prompt you to apply knowledge of the following skills and tools:

Penetration testing with Kali Linux.

Log and incident analysis with Kibana.

System hardening and configuration.

Reporting, documentation, and communication.




Lab Environment

Click here to view the lab environnement.

In this unit, you will be using the Red vs Blue lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services. RDP into the Windows RDP host machine.
Open the Hyper-V Manager to access the nested machines:

-ELK machine holds the Kibana dashboards.
-Kali: A standard Kali Linux machine for use in the penetration test on Day 1.
-Capstone: Filebeat and Metricbeat are installed and will forward logs to the ELK machine.

What to Be Aware Of:
Throughout Day 2, it is important that you take screen shots of each step they complete. These screen shots will be used in their Day 3 Report.


Day 1:

Red Team Vs Blue Team
What is Vulnerability Scanning
What is a reverse shell

Day 2:

Kibana: Discover Documentation
Kibana: Visualize Documentation
Elasticsearch Reference Documentation

Looking Forward
In the next week, we will cover the specialized field of digital forensics. We will cover a new set of skills and tools that allow us to analyze evidence on digital technology after an security incident or crime occurs.
